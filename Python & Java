python Basics:
it is a beginner-friendly programming language that is used in web development.
this programming language is known of its easy to read syntax and of its capabilities. 
To install packages on Python make use of "pip install" 
To verifie a version "python --version"
To run a script "python your file name.py"
To add comment #

Python Variables:
Refers to a name that refers to a value stored in the computers memory. Variable allow you to store, manipulate, & retrieve data within your programs.
Use descriptive names for your variables to make your code more readable and maintainable
Declaring Variables:
You will simply assign a value to a variable using the = operator. 

Basic Data types:
integers (int)
age = "30"
float-point numbers (float)
height = "5.9"
strings (str)
name = "Alice"
boolean values (bool)
To control flow of your program:
Conditional statements (if, else, elif) 
Loops (for, while)

Compound Data Types:
list (list)
Alphabets  = ["A", "B", "C"]
Tuple (tuple)
coordinates = (10.1, 20.0)
Dictionary (dict)
person = {"name": "Asiphe", "Age": 24}
Set (set)
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3}

Type Conversion:
Be consistent with your Conversion
Implicit Type Conversion
result = 10 + 3.5
Explicit Type Conversion
num_str = "100" # converts string to integer.

To check data type:

print(typ(age)) # output: <class 'int'>

Operators & Expressions:
Operators refer to special symbols or keywords that perform operations on python variables and values. 
Expressions:
Refers to a combination of values, variables and operators that Python interprets and evaluate to produce results.
Types of Operators: 
Arithmetic Operators: Addition (+), Substraction (-), Multiplication (*), Division (/), Floor division (//), Modulus (%) & Expontiation (**).
Comparison Operators: Equal (==), Not Equal (!=), Greater Than (>), Less Than (<), Greater Than or Equal To (>=)& less Than or Equal To (<=).
Logical Operators: AND (and), OR (or) & NOT (not).
Assignment Operators:  Equal (=), Add and Assign (+ =), Multiply and Assign (*=) & Divide and  Assign (/=).
Identity Operators: Is (is) & Is Not (is not).
Membership Operators: In (in) & Not In (not in).
Bitwise Operators: AND (&) , OR (|), XOR (^), NOT (~), Left Shift (<<) & Right Shift (>>).

Control structures (if-else, loops)
if-else and loops are primary control structures that allow you to dictate the flow of your program.

1. Conditional statement (if-else):
Allow you to execute certain blocks of code based on specific conditions. 
Syntax involves using if, elif (short for "else if"), and else to evaluate expressions and decide which code to run.

If Statement: Executes a block of code if the condition is true.
Elif Statement: Checks another condition if the previous conditions were false.
Else Statement: Executes a block of code if all previous conditions were false.

2. Loops:
They allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times. 
Two types of Loops:
For Loops: Involves lists, tuple, or strings.
Most used over a sequence & executes a block of code for each item in the sequence.
While Loops: Can be used to repeat a block of code as long as a condition is true.

3. Combining if-else with Loops
   you willcombine conditional statements with loops to control how many times a loop runs or to break out of a loop early.

4. Best Practices:
   Identation
   Clear Conditions
   Avoid Infinite Loops

Functions & Modules:
These concepts help you to organize, reuse & manage your code efficiently. 

1. Function:
Refers to blocks of reuseable code that perfom a specific task.
Functions allow you to breake down your code into smaller, manageable pieces.
You define a function by using the def keyword, followed by the function word. inside the function yu write the code that you want to execute when the function is called.
2. Modules:
Are files that contain Python code, which can include functions, variables & classes.
Your modules should be saved in a .py file.
To import a module in your program, you must import it using the import keyword.

Lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets:
These are Python data structures that are essential for organizing and managing data.
1. Lists:
   It is an ordered collection of items that can hold a variety of data types (integers, strings, other lists)
   CHARACTERISTICS:
   Order: have order and indexed
   Mutability: can be modified by add, removing or changing elements
   Heterogeneous: they can contain different types of data.

Common Operations: 
Adding Items: uses append() to add an item to the end of a list, insert () to add at a specific position
Accessing Items: Use indexing (list[0] for the first item or slicing for a sublist [1:3]
Removing Items: use remove() to remove a specific item or pop() to remove an item at a specific index.
Looping Through Lists: Uses for loop to iterate through each item in the list

2. Tuples:
   Refers to an order of collection of items similar to a list but unlike lists, tuples are immutable. onces created they cannot be changed.
   CHARACTERISTICS:
   Order: are ordered & indexed 
   Immutable: cannot be modified
   Heterogeneous: they can contain different types of data.

Common Operations:
Accessing Items: similar to lists, allow you to use indexing & slicing
Tuple Unpacking: Assign elements of a tuple to multiple variables in one step
Creating Single-Element Tuples: usea comma after the single element (my_tuple = (5,)).

3. Dictionaries:
It is collection of key-value pairs where each key is unique. Dictionaries are mutable, allowing you to change, add, or remove key-value pairs. 
CHARACTERISTICS:
Key-Value Pairs: each item in a dictionary consists of a key & its associated value.
Unordered: Dictionaries do not maintain the order of items 
Mutability: you can modify the contents of dictionaries

Common Operations:
Adding/Modifying Items: Assign a value to a key using dict[key] = value.
Accessing Values: Use the key to access its associated value (e.g., dict["key"]).
Removing Items: Use del dict[key] to remove a key-value pair or pop() to remove a key and return its value.
Looping Through Dictionaries: Use a for loop to iterate over keys, values, or both.

4. Sets:
A set is an unordered collection of unique items. Sets are mutable, but they do not allow duplicate elements.
Characteristics:
Unordered: Sets do not maintain the order of items.
Unique Items: Each item in a set must be unique; duplicates are automatically removed.
Mutability: You can add or remove items from a set.

Common Operations:
Adding Items: Use add() to add a single item to a set.
Removing Items: Use remove() or discard() to remove an item from a set.
Set Operations: Perform union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference using operators like |, &, -, and ^.
Looping Through Sets: Use a for loop to iterate through each item in the set.

Python Libraries:
libraries are powerful tools used for data manipulation, analysis & numerical computation. 
Libraries are pre-written code that you can import into your project to extend the functionality of your programs. 
NumPy: Are used when working with large arrays & matrices are ideal for numerical computation.
KEY FEATURES:
-Ndarray
-Vectorization
-Broadcasting
COMMON OPERATIONS:
-Creating Arrays
-Mathematical Operations
-Reshaping Arrays
-Aggregations


#JAVA
Before you start with Java yu need to set a Java development environment. 
install JDK (Java Development Kit) & select an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to write, compile & run your Java programs.
Pandas: Can be used to analyse data & for data manipulation especially when dealing with structured data like tables.
KEY FEATURES:
-Series & DataFrames
-Data Cleaning
-Data Manipulation
-Data Analysis
COMMON OPERATIONS:
-Creating DataFrames
-Selecting Data
-Handling Missing Data
-Grouping Data

INSTALLATION:

import pandas as pd
To verify your installation:
on your terminal [java -version]

VARIABLES, DATA TYPES, OPERATORS
VARIABLES:
It is a container that holds data that can be changed during the execution of a program. this type of data includes name, a data type & a value.
DECLARATION & INITIALIZATION:
Before you use a variable you must declare it by specifying its data type & name.
TYPES OF VARIABLES
-Local variables: Are declared within a method & are accessible only within that metho.
-Instance variables: Are declared within a class but outside methods; accessible by all methods in the class.
-Static variables: Are declared within static keyword; are shared among all instances of a class.

DATA TYPES IN JAVA:
                   PRIMITIVE DATA TYPES
-Primitive data types are eight build-in java data types.
>bytes: 8-bit integers
>short: 16-bit integers
>int: 32-bit integer, commonly used for numeric data
>long:64-bit integers, used when a wider range than int is needed
>float:32-bit floating-point number, for decimal values
>double:64-bit floating-point number, more precise than float
>char:16-bit Unicode character, used for storing individual characters
>boolean: represents true or false values

REFERENCE DATA TYPES:
>Refes to objects and arrays, these type of that are more complex and include classes, interfaces & arrays. they store the memory address where the object is located rather than the object itself.

OPERATORS IN JAVA:
Arithmetic Operators
-Are used to perform mathematical operations such as  (+); (-); (*); (/) & (%)
Relational Operator
-Are used to compare two values, returning a boolean results. Examples include equali (==); inequality (!=); greater than (>), & less than (<).
Logical Operators
-Are used to combine multiple boolean expressions or values. Common logical operators include AND (&&); OR (||), AND NOT (!).
Assignment Operators
-Are used to assign values to variables. Assignment operator (=), the are other compound assignment operators like +=, -=, *=, and /=.
Unary Operators
-Operate on a single operand. Increment (++); decrement (--); use to increase or decrease the values of a variable by one. 
Conditional (Ternary) Operator:
-refers to a shorthand way to perform an if-else check in a single line. the syntax is condition? expression1 : expression2.

CONTROL STRUCTURES (if-else, loops)
if-else and loops are primary control structures that allow you to dictate the flow of your program.
1. CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS: if-else
   if statement:
If Statement: Executes a block of code if the condition is true.
   else statement:
Else Statement: Executes a block of code if all previous conditions were false.
    else if Statement:
The else if statement allows you to check multiple conditions. If the first if condition is false, the program checks the next else if condition, and so on.
2. Loops:
They allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times. 
Two types of Loops:
For Loops: Involves lists, tuple, or strings.
Most used over a sequence & executes a block of code for each item in the sequence.
While Loops: Can be used to repeat a block of code as long as a condition is true.
do-while loops: is similar to the while loop, but the block of code is executed at least once before the condition is tested. This guarantees that the loop runs at least one time, regardless of the condition.
Breaking & Continuing Loops:
-break Statement
-continue Statement
3. Practical Application:
   Conditional Execution:
> Use if-else statements to control which blocks of code run based on dynamic conditions, such as user input or the current state of the program.
    Iteration with Loops:
> Use loops to perform repetitive tasks, such as iterating through arrays or collections, processing user input repeatedly, or generating sequences of numbers.


FUNCTIONS & METHODS
Functions are known as methods on Java, they are essential building blocks. 
They allow you to encapsulate code into reusable, organized units, making your programs more modular, readable and easy to debug. 
1. Methods
   Refers to a block of code that performs a specific task.
   Methods can take inputs, execute code & return a result. 
2. Defining & Calling Methods
   methods are defined within a class:
   -Access Modifier: Determnes the visibility (public & private)
   -Return Type: specifies the type of value the method will return (into, void if it returns nothing)
   -Method Name: identifies the method, following standard naming conventions
   -Parameter List: Inputs required by the method, enclosed in parentheses.
   -Method Body: The block of code that runs when the method is called, enclosed in curly braces.
   CALLING A METHOD:
   -To execute a method call it by using its name followed by parenteses. if the method requires parameters, you pass them within the parentheses.
   3. TYPES OF METHODS
      > STATIC METHODS
      > INSTANCE METHOD
      > VOID METHOD
      > RETURN TYPE METHODS
   4. METHOD OVERLOADING
      -Refers to allowing multiple methods in the same class to have the same name but different parameter lists. Java determines which method to call based on the number and type of parameters passed.
      5. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
         - ENCAPSULATION
         - REUSABILITY
         - ABSTRACTION
        
CLASSES AND OBJECTS
1. Understanding Classes
A class in Java is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a data structure by specifying the properties (attributes or fields) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from the class can have.

Key Concepts:
-Attributes (fields): Refers to variables that store the state of an object
-Methods: Refers to functions that define the behavior of an object. These functions operate on the object'sattributes & can perform actions or return values.
-Constructors: Refers to special methods used to initialize objects when they are created. They often set initial values for attributes. 

2. CREATING OBJECTS
An object is an instance of a class. When you create an object, you are essentially bringing the class blueprint to life, giving it a specific state by assigning values to its attributes.

KEY POINTS:
> Instantiation: Create an object from a class using the new keyword
> Accessing Attributes & Methods: Use the dot (.) operator to access an object's attributes & methods.

3. KEY OOP CONEPTS: ENCAPSULATION, INHERITANCE & POLYMORPHISM
   > ENCAPSULATION:  Wrapping the data (attributes) and the code (methods) together into a single unit called a class. This concept also involves restricting access to some of the object's components using access modifiers like private, protected, and public.
   > INHERITANCE: Refers to a mechanism where one class can inherit fieds & methods from another class. (code reuse & relationship between classes).
   > POLYMORPHISM: Refers to the ability of objects of different clases related by inheritance to respond to method calls of the same name, each one according to its appropriate type.

4. BEST PRACTISES
   > Use meaningful names
   >  Encapsulate data
   > Reuse Code
   
INHERITANCE & POLYMORPHISM
Inheritance and Polymorphism are two cornerstone concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java. These principles allow you to create flexible, reusable, and organized code by establishing relationships between classes and enabling objects to behave in different ways.

1. Inheritance
   Allows new class (subclass or child class) to inherit fields & methods from an existing class (superclass or parent class).
   This enables you to create a hierarchy of classes that share common behavior, promoting code reuse and reducing redundancy.

   KEY CONCEPTS:
   >Superclass (parent Class)
   >Subclass (Child Class)
   >extends Keyword

2. Polymorphism
   allows objects of different classes related by inheritance to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It also enables methods to be used in multiple forms, depending on the object that invokes them.

   KEY CONCEPTS:
   > Method Overriding
   > Dynamic method Dispatch

3. IMPORTANCE OF INHERITANCE 7 POLYMORPHISM
   > Code Reusability
   > Extensibility
   > Maintainability
   > Flexibility

4. Best Practices
   > Use Inheritance Wisely
   > Override Methods Carefully
   > Leverage Polymorphism

1. EXCEPTION HANDLING:
-Exception handling is the process of responding to these exceptions in a structured way, so the program can continue to operate or terminate gracefully.
-exception refers to an event that disrupts the normal flow of the program. Exeptions are objects that represents errors or unexpected conditions that occur during the execution of a program.

 KEY CONCEPTS:
> Exception
> Exception Handling
    TYPES OF EXCEPTIONS
> Checked Exceptions: are checked at compile-time (e.g., IOException).
> Unchecked Exceptions: occur at runtime (e.g., ArithmeticException, NullPointerException).
> Errors: are usually beyond the control of the program (e.g., OutOfMemoryError).

2. The try-catch Block
- is the foundation of exception handling in Java. It allows you to try a block of code and catch any exceptions that occur, providing an opportunity to handle the error.

  KEY CONCEPTS:
> try Block: contains the code that might throw an exception
> catch Block: catches & handles exceptions if occurs. you can have multiple catch bloks to handle different types of exceptions.
> finally Block: optional; ) Executes code after try and catch, regardless of whether an exception was thrown. It's typically used for cleanup activities, like closing resources.

3. THROWING EXCEPTINS:
- This can be done mannualy by using the throw keyword.

KEY POINTS:
> throw Keyword
> Custom Exceptions

4. Best Practices
   > Catch Specific Exceptions
   > Use finally for Cleanup
   > Custom Exceptions
   > Avoid Empty Catch Blocks
